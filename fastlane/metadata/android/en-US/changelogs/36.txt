In 1.7.0, there are big design and functionality changes!

Main Changes:

    Overhauled the My Calendar section, now it has a real calendar which you can use to schedule and log workouts!

    While you can still start your workouts through the new calendar, Start Workout section is gone for improved UX

    Graphs section now resides directly at My Progress tab, you can still access your logs from there as well.

    Now it remembers your notification and vibration preferences before you start your workout!

    Last but not least, some usual bugfixes
